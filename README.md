# Data-Analyst-Science
## Small projects built by myself. The projects cover most of what I know about data analytics and machine learning
## In this project, I used the following skills:
- Python
- Sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy, pandas
- The basic machine learning algorithms are:
  + LinearSVC, SVC, KNeighborsClassifier, LogisticRegression, DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, ExtraTreesClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier, XGBClassifier
  + Algorithms used in a functional way are available from sklearn, the algorithms give different accuracy rates. Based on that, we can choose the best algorithm for the     data set
## Machine learning projects will be executed in the following order:
#### Scoping -> Data Processing -> Modelling
