# Kaggle Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster


## Competition Description

> The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.
>
> One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.
>
> In this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.

## Main content in the code
- Basic processing of data for ease of use during analysis
- EDA and finding fundamental insights in datasets
- Finding correlation between columns in data
- Feature Engineering and Data Wrangling
- Filling missing values
- Build basic machine learning models for data

## Basic information was found in the data
- Only 38% survived the disaster
- Female survival rate > male
- Most People embarked on Southampton, and also had the highest people not survived
- 1st class higher survival rate
- People don't going with family are mostly not survived. the number of passenger with 1-2 family members has a better chance of survival
- People don't going with children or parents are mostly not survived
- Majority passengers were from 18-40 ages, chilren had more chance to survive than other ages
- Fare does not follow a normal distribution and has a huge spike at the price range [0â€“100$]
- The distribution is skewed to the left with 75% of the fare paid under $31 and a max paid fare of $512
- Passenger with Luxury and Expensive Fare will have more chance to survive
